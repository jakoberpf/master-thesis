\subsection{Congestion - Roadworks categorizes as Jam Initiator}
\label{analysis_processing_correlation_arbis_initiator}
In the methodology \cref{methodology_data_processing} it was stated that a classification of congestion - roadwork matched would be viable to analysis congestion which are specifically allocated spatial and temporal in from of a roadwork. Unfortunately the timeframe of the these didn't allow for the integrating the results. The analysis was finished just in time of finishing the thesis, however this did not leave time for implementing the analysis results in the textual part of the thesis, yet the results of the analysis are available in the repository linked in the introduction. Additionally a quick review of the \textit{Jam Initiator} analysis did not show break-thought results, which mitigates the scientific damage of leaving out this planned part of the analysis.
