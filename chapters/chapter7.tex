\chapter{Summary of analysis}
\label{analysis_summary}
In the previous chapter the datasets where analyzed for collections and the relevance of the correlation was evaluated in detail. The analysis has presented that there are a number of separated statistical statements and interpretations, which need to be summarized to comprise a general statement. This is the topic of this chapter. Since this summary and is based on the analysis of the previous chapter, only significant correlations which hold a relevant interpretability are considered.

\section{Accidents}
\label{analysis_summary_accident}
The analysis of the \textit{congestion - accident} correlations is separated into sections to account for the different accident types of Initiator, Effector and Follower (see \cref{methodology_data_processing}). In this section, the findings for each accident characteristic from the different categories are collected, summarized and interpreted. 

\subsection{Street (\textit{Strasse})}
\label{analysis_sum_Strasse}
The relation classes of \textit{Jam Initiator} and \textit{Jam Follower} don't show any relevance in the found collections. In the case of the \textit{Jam Initiator} this is especially unfortunate, since it is the most promising group for predictions. The relations in the complete matched dataset and the relation class of \textit{Jam Effector} are summarizes in the following.

\textbf{Duration} : The maximum and average jam duration is generally related to the street but not all streets show statistical significant differences. Therefore there is no general significant trend to be interpreted but since the relation has a general significance and individual significant differences are presented it can be assumed that the descriptives are generally representable. When comparing all descriptive means (shown in \cref{fig:baysis_summary_Str_duration_barplot}) it becomes clear that the maximum and average variables differ by high ranges, which is to be expected, but also show a similar trend.

The comparison of the global and \textit{Jam Effector} variables presents a general increase of means from the global to \textit{Jam Effector} variable. This means that accidents during a congestion are associated with (temporal) longer jams than jams in general.

\textbf{Length} : The maximum and average jam length is generally related to the street but not all streets show statistical significant differences. Therefore, there is no general significant trend to be interpreted. But since the relation presents a general significance and individual significant differences it can be assumed that the descriptives are generally representable. When comparing all descriptive means (shown in \cref{fig:baysis_summary_Str_length_barplot}) it becomes clear, that the maximum and average variables differ by high ranges, which is to be expected, but also show a similar trend.

Just as the jam duration the comparison of the global and \textit{Jam Effector} variables presents a general increase of means from the global to \textit{Jam Effector} variable. This means that accidents during a congestion are associated with (spatial) longer jams than jams in general.

\textbf{Coverage} : The jam coverage is generally related to the street with most road showing statistical significant differences. Therefore, it can be assumed that the descriptives are generally representable. The comparison of the global and \textit{Jam Effector} variables (shown in \cref{fig:baysis_summary_Str_coverage_barplot}) presents a general decrease of means from the global to \textit{Jam Effector} variable. This means that accidents during a congestion are associated with less denser jams than jams in general.

\end{figure}
In accordance with these findings it can be interpreted that in general the street plays a significant role defining the size and form of a congestion. This is not surprising since the demand on the street which varies heavily between the roads is the major factor influencing the buildup of a congestion. Nonetheless it is interesting that the differences are substantial with ranges up to 60\,\% increases between groups and are replicated over difference variable relations. Another effect is the increased jam duration and length in the \textit{Jam Effector} dataset in comparison with jams in general. This is due to either the higher probability of an accident in very long jams or that accidents during a jam could increase the jam extends itself.

\subsection{Accident category (\textit{Kat})}
\label{analysis_sum_Kat}
The variable \textit{Kat} showed a general dependence to the maximum and average duration and a general trend of increasing duration with the injury gravity of the accident. In the global dataset the category of accidents with property damage does not fit into this trend and sits in-between the lightly and heavily injured category. This changes when considering just the \textit{Jam Initiators}, where all categories follow one increasing trend. When comparing all descriptive means (shown in \cref{fig:baysis_summary_Kat_duration_barplot}) it becomes clear, that the maximum and average variables differ by high ranges, which is to be expected. The comparison also shows that that the jam duration significantly increases with the gravity of the accident. The category of deadly accidents differs by 130\,min from accidents of lightly injured and property damage accidents. 
\begin{figure}[ht!]

    \label{fig:baysis_summary_Kat_duration_barplot}
    %\vspace{-8mm}
\end{figure}
Unlike the temporal length the spatial length does not correlate with the accident category. Even though according to the global dataset the temporal distance is heavily related to the accident category, the descriptives only show a maximum difference of 6\,min, which is arguably low for an interpretation. Nonetheless in can be stated that the temporal distance between accident and congestion increased significantly with the injury gravity. The variable also correlates in other datasets but without significant differences.

\subsection{Accident type (\textit{Typ})}
\label{analysis_sum_Typ}
The variable \textit{Typ} only significantly relates to the temporal distance between the accident and congestion. In the global dataset accidents of the kind \textit{driving accident} and \textit{other} (average of 8.5\,min) have a longer temporal distance than crossing accident or accidents in straight traffic (average of 3.5\,min). A similar significant difference can also be observed in the \textit{Jam Initiator} dataset with a temporal distance of \textit{driving} and \textit{other} accidents (average of 12\,min) compared to \textit{merging}, \textit{crossing} and \textit{straight traffic} accidents (average of 8\,min). The variable also correlates with other variables but again without significant differences. When comparing all descriptive means (shown in \cref{fig:baysis_summary_Typ_TDist_barplot}) it becomes clear, that the temporal distance increases for \textit{Jam Initiators}
and the trend shown in both datasets is mirrored.

    \label{fig:baysis_summary_Typ_TDist_barplot}
    %\vspace{-8mm}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Accident kind (\textit{UArt})}
\label{analysis_sum_UArt}
The global dataset shows correlations of the accident kind and the temporal distance, as well as the coverage which are both significant. Collisions with \textit{starting}, \textit{standing}, \textit{stopping}, \textit{ahead and waiting vehicles} and \textit{vehicles on separate lane in same direction} take an average of 5\,min to form jams, when accident collisions with \textit{obstacles} or \textit{left/right} nearby vehicles take an average of 8\,min to form a congestion. Accidents of the category \textit{turning} and \textit{crossing} vehicles have the most immediate reaction of 2.5\,min. The \textit{Jam Initiator} dataset show the same features of accident collisions with \textit{starting}, \textit{standing}, \textit{stopping}, \textit{turning}, \textit{crossing}, \textit{ahead and waiting vehicles} and \textit{vehicles on separate lane in same direction} having an average of 9\,min and accident collisions with \textit{obstacles} or \textit{left/right} nearby vehicles an average of 12\,min. This can also be seen in \cref{fig:baysis_summary_UArt1_TDist_barplot} where the two dataset variables are compared directly.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \pgfplotstableread[col sep=comma]{
        Typ, gMeanTDist, iMeanTDist, means

        7 , 12.63 , 15.26 , 13.9
        8 , 8.79  , 11.81 , 10.3
        9 , 9.10  , 11.38 , 10.2

    \centering
    \barplotdoublewithmeans{\datasorted}{$\bar{x}_{TDist,global}$}{$\bar{x}_{TDist,initiator}$}{8.6}
    \caption{Comparison of descriptives $\bar{x}_{TDist,global}$ and $\bar{x}_{TDist,initiator}$ by \textit{UArt}}
    \label{fig:baysis_summary_UArt1_TDist_barplot}
    %\vspace{-8mm}
\end{figure}
The coverage relation shows the same grouping as the temporal distance. Accident collisions with \textit{starting}, \textit{standing}, \textit{stopping}, \textit{ahead and waiting vehicles} and \textit{vehicles on separate lane in same direction} have an average coverage of 41\,\% and are therefore associated with less dense jams than accident collisions with \textit{obstacles} or \textit{left/right} nearby vehicles which have an average coverage of 54\,\%. Jams associated with accidents of the category \textit{turning} and \textit{crossing} vehicles are the least dense with 33\,\%. The \textit{Jam Initiator} dataset presents the same trend and supports the findings but without any significant groups. In the \textit{Jam Initiator} dataset \textit{UArt} also correlates significantly with the maximal temporal extend but only in the form that accidents with vehicles on the \textit{separate lane in the same direction} can be associated with 24\,min longer jams, than accidents with \textit{obstacles} in general.

\subsection{Accident cause (\textit{AUrs})}
\label{analysis_sum_AUrs}
The accident cause describing variable \textit{AUrs} is related to the average spatial extend, temporal distance and coverage only without significant group differences. The descriptives show minor features like for example the jam coverage decreases with the accident causes \textit{slippery street due to rain} to \textit{cart track due to rain, snow or ice} by 13\,\% on average in the \textit{Jam Initiator} dataset. The global dataset shows the same feature with an average decrease of 17\,\%. It also reveals that the (spatial) jam length increases with the accident causes \textit{slippery street due to rain} over \textit{visibility issues due to sun or glare} to \textit{slippery street due to snow or ice} by 2382\,m on average. The temporal distance between accident and congestion decreases with the accident causes \textit{Slippery street due to snow or ice} and \textit{slippery street due to rain} (average of 7.7\,min) to \textit{visibility issues due to sun or glare} to by 3\,min on average.

\subsection{Accident collision object type (\textit{AufHi})}
\label{analysis_sum_AufHi}
The variable \textit{AufHi} describes the type of collision object and is related to the temporal distance and coverage in the global dataset. The temporal distance between jams and accidents is 4.7\,min for \textit{trees} and 8.4\,min for \textit{guardrail} or \textit{other obstacles}. The jam coverage of collisions with \textit{trees} (40\,\% coverage) is 10\,\% lower than the 50\,\% coverage of the groups of \textit{guardrails} or \textit{other obstacles}. The variable also correlates with other variables but without meaningful interpretation or significance.

\subsection{Accident environment characteristic (\textit{Char})}
\label{analysis_sum_Char}
The accident characteristic variable correlates significantly with the temporal distance in the \textit{Jam Initiator} dataset but without group specific differences.

\subsection{Accident lighting environment (\textit{Lich})}
\label{analysis_sum_Lich}
The lighting situation correlates significantly with the coverage and shows that jams in darkness are 18\,\% denser than jams in daylight. The state of the street lighting shows a similar effect of 10\,\% denser jams in case of broken street lighting.

\subsection{Road condition (\textit{Zust})}
\label{analysis_sum_Zust}
The road condition correlates with the coverage of a jam in the way that the coverage increases by 20\,\%-25\,\% from \textit{dry} over \textit{wet} to \textit{ice}.

\subsection{Weekday (\textit{WoTag})}
\label{analysis_sum_WoTag}
The week day correlates with the spatial and temporal extends as well as the temporal distance, coverage and time loss in multiple datasets. But only the coverage and time loss (HGV) correlation show significant differences. The coverage of jams on Monday's, Saturday's and Sunday's is 7\,\%-8\,\% higher than on other week days. The variable also correlates with other variables but without meaningful interpretation or significance.

\subsection{Month (\textit{Month})}
\label{analysis_sum_Month}
The month of the accident correlates in multiple datasets and with most congestion variables but only in the \textit{Jam Effector} the maximal and average spatial extend shows significant differences. The months of January and November have the shortest extends when July and December have the longest. Together with the other months they do not form a distinctive trend. 

\section{Roadworks}
\label{analysis_summary_roadwork}
Unlike the analysis of the \textit{congestion - accident} correlations, roadwork correlations are not separated into global and \textit{Jam Initiator}. Although the methodology in \cref{methodology_data_processing} stated that a classification of \textit{congestion - roadwork} matched would be viable to analysis congestion which are specifically allocated spatial and temporal in front of a roadwork. The analysis was finished just in time of the thesis, however this did not leave time for implementing the analysis results in the textual part. Yet the results of the analysis are available in the repository linked in the introduction. Also, as stated in \cref{analysis_processing_correlation_arbis_initiator} a quick review of the \textit{Jam Initiator} analysis did not show break-thought results and is therefore skipped in this chapter.

\subsection{Street (\textit{Strasse})}
\label{analysis_arbis_sum_Strasse}
Due to the very high number of samples, the road of the roadwork correlates strongly and significantly with all of the congestion characteristics. 

\textbf{Duration} : The maximum and average jam duration is generally related to the street of the roadwork but not all months show statistical significant differences and therefore, there is no general significant trend to be interpreted. But because the relation presented a general significance and individual significant differences, it can be assumed that the descriptives are generally representable. When comparing all descriptive means (shown in \cref{fig:arbis_summary_Str_temporal}) it becomes clear, that the maximum and average variables differ by high ranges, which is to be expected, but also show a similar trend.

The diagram is sorted by the mean of maximal and average duration and therefore shows that the A70 and A3 have considerable longer jams and the A96, A71 and A995 considerable shorter jams in comparison to the mean. 

\textbf{Length} : The maximum and average jam length is generally related to the street of the roadwork but not all streets show statistical significant differences. Therefore there is no general significant trend to be interpreted but since the relation has a general significance and individual significant differences are present it can be assumed that the descriptives are generally representable. When comparing all descriptive means (shown in \cref{fig:arbis_summary_Str_spatial}) it becomes clear that the maximum and average variables differ by high ranges, which is to be expected, but also show a similar trend.

The A9 and A96 have a significantly higher temporal distance than the A3, A7 and A92, but the difference is only about 2\,min. The general trend of the temporal distance shows that the A9, A71, A73 and A96 have higher distances, with a maximum deviation of 2\,min from the overall $\bar{x}$.

The spatial distance can be interpreted that the roads A94 and A99 have a higher distance (302\,m on average) than the A73 and A93. The general trend also that the A94, A995, A99 and A9 have considerable higher and the A70, A73, A93, A71 considerable lower distances when compared to the overall $\bar{x}$ of 145\,m.

For the coverage it can be interpreted that the road A70, A92, A93, and A96 have a significantly higher coverage than the A3, A73 and A99. The time-loss of cars and heavy goods vehicles correlate significantly, but don't provide interpretable differences.

\subsection{Number closed lanes (\textit{AnzGesperrtFs})}
The number of closed lane does not correlate with any congestion characteristic.

\subsection{Lane diversion (\textit{Einzug})}
The gravity of the lane diversion does not correlate with any congestion characteristic.

\subsection{Spatial length (\textit{Length})}
The spatial length of the roadwork does not correlate with any congestion characteristic. 

\subsection{Month (\textit{Month})}
The month of the roadwork correlates strongly with most of the congestion characteristics. 

\textbf{Duration} : The average jam duration is generally related to the month of the roadwork and almost all months show statistical significant differences. Therefore there is a general significant trend to be interpreted and the descriptives are generally representable. The descriptive means (shown in \cref{fig:arbis_summary_month_duration}) show a general trend.

The distribution can be interpreted that the September deviated heavily from the mean, with 52\,min. Therefore it can be interpreted that roadworks in September result in significantly longer jam durations than the average. The descriptives also show that April, May, June and July have considerable lower durations than the average. Therefore it can be interpreted that roadworks in April, May, June and July result be significantly shorter jam durations than the average. 

\textbf{Length} : The maximum and average jam length is generally related to the month of the roadwork and almost all months show statistical significant differences. Therefore there is a general significant trend to be interpreted and the descriptives are generally representable. When comparing all descriptive means (shown in \cref{fig:arbis_matched_meancomparison_month_spatial}) it becomes clear, that the maximum and average variables differ by high ranges, which is to be expected, but also show a similar trends.

The distribution can be interpreted that roadworks in October and December result in significantly longer spatial distances than the average. The roadwork jams in January, February and July result in significantly shorter spatial distances than the average. The coverage of jams shows that roadworks in September, October, November and December result in significantly denser jams than the average. The roadwork jams in March and July trend to be significantly less dense jams than the average. The time-loss correlation shows significance, but very similar descriptives, which means there are no interpretable differences.

\section{Predictability of accidents and jams}
\label{analysis_summary_predictability}
The correlation summary in the sections before showed that there are multiple accident characteristics, which correlate significantly with jams features. Theses significant correlations already provide a statement about the predictions for these relations, but should be further investigated for reliable results. This can be done statistical with hte already introduced Theil's $U$ (see \cref{correlation_predictability}). As defined in the statistical theory chapter Theil's $U$ can be only applied on categorical variables which is why the interval characteristics of the congestion object need to be converted into representable categories. This categorization which can also be called binning and is achieved by using the quantile-based discretization function \textit{qcut} from the Pandas framework. The function creates equal sized bins (quantiles) of the measurements, creating an equally good sample sets for all categories. 

Based on these categorized measurements (four categories per measurement) from the congestion and the incident characteristics the predictability can be evaluated with Theil's $U$.

The predictability processing which is similar to the correlation processing, produces a matrix of the predictability $U$ for each relation. In accordance to the defined interpretation of $U$ in \cref{correlation_predictability} any relations with a value close to $1$ can be considered as predictable, whereas values closer to $0$ are considered to be not predictable. When reviewing the visual representation of the predictability matrixes for accidents (see \cref{img:baysis_predictability_matrix}) and roadworks (see \cref{img:arbis_predictability_matrix}) it becomes clear that none of the relations shows clear predictability, due to a maximum of .34 in all relevant $Us$. Additionally it should be pointed out that all values but the single .34 are below .2 which very close to $0$. The maximum value of .34 is reached by the relation \textit{AUrs2} - \textit{TDist}. This means that all relations show no or very low predictability but the relation of \textit{AUrs2} - \textit{TDist} which shows at least a low predictability.
